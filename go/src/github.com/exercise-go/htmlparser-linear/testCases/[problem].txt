Coding Exercise CE1.0
=====================

Latest version of this document avaliable [here](http://notepag.es/aCodersCE1).

You are supposed to write a program that would read an html file and print its
content as plain text.
For eg:

    <p>Hello <b>Cruel</b><a href="http://www.worldbank.org">world</a></p>

is converted to

    Hello Cruel world

Requirements
------------
 -  Output starts with the Document title if it exists. Title should be underlined
  with `=` and followed by 2 newlines. 
 -  All block level elements & `br` should be prefixed OR suffixed with a new 
	line so that the plain text is readable.
 -	For intending lines/list items , use `TAB` character. 
 -	`hr` should be replaced with a 80 char long line made up of underscores.
 -	HTML Special Entities need not be processed, but you can if you wish.
 -	We can forget about character encoding. Expect all text to be simple plain
	text (aka ASCII).
 -	You cannot use any HTML/XML Parser libraries/functions or regex.
	You need to do it all with your own code.
	Eg: You cannot use php `strip_tag()` function or python `HTMLParser` 
 -	The program would be invoked with 1st argument as path to HTML file. This 
	file should be read and its content printed as plain text.
	
Test Cases
----------
The test cases for your code can be found in `ce1_test_cases.zip`. It contains
some html files and their expected output. You are free to deviate from this
ideal output but its always better if you can come up with something more 
similar. For the application to be considered functional, it should handle 
`The good.html` correctly. If it processes `The Bad.html` well, we can consider 
the application done. If you really feel **smart** and wanna do it all *RIGHT*,
you need process `The Ugly.html` correctly. For development, start getting 
things done for `404.html`
